# Résumé

## Why HTML and CSS?

A couple of people have asked me why I bothered to make my resume using HTML and CSS, and... to be fair, it's a great question! 

For a while I played around with making my resume in Microsoft
Word, Google Docs, Photoshop, and InDesign. I found with each one I tried, there still was some frustration I had. With Word and Docs, having separate alignments on the same line was a pain (e.g. the resume entry is left-aligned, the date is right aligned on the same line). With Photoshop, having to edit text frequently for content changes was annoying, and I'd often have to transform all of the boxes to get things looking snappy again. InDesign solves a good amount of these issues, but in the end, I just found it clunky and a bit tedious when setting up all of the formatting rules and applying them to a document that can undergo significant changes pretty regularly.

I had experience with HTML and CSS, and figured I would give it a try. As it turns out, this process allowed me to control the content, structure, and appearance just like I wanted all along. Plus, I got the following benefits:
- Version control
- Another public repo for my somewhat barren GitHub
- Other people could use this for themselves

If you want to enjoy these benefits, fork away, friend!

## Rendering/Printing
The CSS includes margins so all margins in the Page Setup of the browser's print function should be set to `0.0`.
