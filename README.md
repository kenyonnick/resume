# Résumé

## Why HTML and CSS?

A couple of people have asked me why I bothered to make my resume using HTML and CSS, and... to be fair, it's a great question! 

For a while I played around with making my resume in Microsoft
Word, Google Docs, Photoshop, and InDesign. I found with each one I tried, there still was some frustration I had. With Word and Docs, having separate alignments on the same line was a pain (e.g. the resume entry is left-aligned, the date is right aligned on the same line). With Photoshop, having to edit text frequently for content changes was annoying, and I'd often have to transform all of the boxes to get things looking snappy again. InDesign solves a good amount of these things, but in the end, I just found it clunky and a bit tedious when setting up all of the formatting rules and applying them.

I had experience with HTML and CSS, and figured I would give it a try. As it turns out, this process allowed me to control the content, structure, and appearance just like I wanted all along. Plus, I got the following benefits:
- Version control
- Another public repo for my somewhat barren GitHub
- Other people could use this for themselves

If you want to enjoy these benefits, fork away, friend!

## Rendering/Printing
One big problem I'm having with creating my resume with HTML and CSS is that what I see in my browser doesn't 100% reflect what the print version looks like. So, my workflow is:
1. Make a change
2. Check the browser render
    - If it looks good, open the Print Preview
        - If the print preview doesn't look right, go back to 1.
